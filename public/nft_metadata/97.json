Add the flour, olive oil, sugar, and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Prepare the Pizza: Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal parts. Roll out each part on a floured surface to form two 12-inch pizza crusts. Transfer the crusts to lightly greased pizza pans or baking sheets. Assemble the Pizza: Spread the pizza sauce evenly over each crust. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Sprinkle dried oregano and basil on top of the cheese. Bake: Bake the pizzas in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Serve: Let the pizzas cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Servings: 2 pizzas (12 slices total, serving 8-12 people) Luigi a'loves when people make the a'pizz for party! Everybody a'loves A'Pizz Luigi!"
