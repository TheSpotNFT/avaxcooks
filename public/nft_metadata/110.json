If the dough is too dry, add water, one tablespoon at a time. If itâ€™s too sticky, add a little more flour.\nRest the Dough:\n\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.\nRoll Out the Dough:\n\nDivide the dough into manageable pieces.\nUsing a rolling pin or a pasta machine, roll each piece of dough into thin sheets, about 1/16 inch thick.\nCut the Noodles:\n\nCut the rolled-out dough into long strips about 3-4 inches wide for lasagna noodles.\nLay the noodles on a floured surface or a clean kitchen towel, making sure they do not overlap.\nCook the Noodles:\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\nCook the noodles in batches for about 2-3 minutes or until they are al dente.\nRemove with a slotted spoon and place them in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.\nDrain and lay them out on a clean kitchen towel to dry slightly before assembling your lasagna.\n\nYou family gonna love you a'so much more when they eat the Luigi's Classico Lasagna!  They gonna tell you \"this the best Luigi's Classico Lasagna! May I have some more, ti prego\""
