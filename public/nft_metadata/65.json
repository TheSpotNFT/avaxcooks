Electric Mixer or Stand Mixer:  An electric mixer or stand mixer will be very helpful for beating the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy, as well as whipping the heavy cream. Spatula:  A spatula will be useful for folding the dry ingredients into the egg mixture and spreading the jam and whipped cream layers. Sifter:  A sifter will be needed to sift the flour, potato starch, and baking powder together to ensure a light and fluffy cake texture. Wire Rack:  A wire rack will help cool the cake layers evenly after they come out of the oven. Cake Stand or Serving Plate:  A cake stand or large serving plate is useful for assembling and presenting the finished cake. Offset Spatula:  An offset spatula can be helpful for spreading the whipped cream evenly over the cake layers and for smoothing the sides of the cake. Piping Bag and Tips (Optional):  If you want to decorate the cake with whipped cream in decorative patterns, a piping bag and tips will be useful. Rolling Pin (Optional):  If you choose to use marzipan to cover the cake or create decorative shapes, a rolling pin will be needed."
