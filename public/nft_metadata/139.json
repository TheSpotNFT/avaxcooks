      "value": "In a large bowl, combine flour, ghee, salt and caraway seeds until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Gradually stir in enough water to form a firm dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 1 hour.\n\nPlace potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until just tender, 8-10 minutes; drain. Set aside to cool slightly. In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add potatoes and cook until potatoes start to cling to the skillet, about 5 minutes. Stir in peas, ginger, garam masala, cumin seeds and salt; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in optional ingredients as desired. Set aside.\n\nDivide dough into 6 pieces. Roll 1 piece of dough into a 10x6-in. oval. Cut dough in half. Moisten straight edge with water. Bring 1 corner of half moon up to meet the other corner of half moon, forming a cone. Pinch seam to seal. Fill with 3-4 tablespoons potato mixture. Moisten curved edge of dough with water; fold over top of filling and press seam to seal. Gently press the bottom of each samosa to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.\n\nPreheat air fryer to 350Â°. Brush the samosas with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil. In batches, arrange in a single layer, without touching, on tray in air-fryer basket. Cook until golden brown, about 15 minutes."
