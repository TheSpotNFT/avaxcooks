Cream Butter and Cheese: In a big bowl, use an electric mixer to blend the butter and cream cheese until smooth.\n3. Add Wet Ingredients: Mix in the egg, milk, and vanilla extract until well combined.\n4. Combine with Sugar: Gradually add powdered sugar, mixing until the mixture becomes fluffy.\n5. Form the Dough: Gently fold in the dry ingredients until everything is mixed well. Then stir in the mini chocolate chips. Pop the dough into the fridge for about an hour to firm it up.\n6. Preheat and Prepare: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\n7. Shape the Cookies: Take out the chilled dough and shape it into 24-26 balls, placing them on the baking sheets about 1.5 inches apart. Slightly flatten each ball.\n8. Add Chocolate Chips: If you're feeling extra indulgent, sprinkle some extra mini chocolate chips on top of each cookie.\n9. Bake: Slide the baking sheets into the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, until the cookies are just starting to turn golden.\n10. Cool: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your delicious Chocolate Chip Cheesecake Cookies!"
