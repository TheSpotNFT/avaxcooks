      "value": "Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for 10 minutes or until tender; drain. Mash potatoes; cool to room temperature.\n\nPreheat air fryer to 375Â°. In a large bowl, stir together potatoes, paneer, cardamom and salt until combined. Spoon 2 tablespoons of potato mixture in lightly greased hands and flatten to 1/8 in. thick. Press a raisin and cashew in the center; bring sides up to enclose. Gently roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining potato mixture. Spritz fryer basket with cooking spray. Working in batches if needed, place balls in a single layer in basket lined with parchment. Cook until golden brown, 10-15 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, for the gravy, in a 6-qt. electric pressure cooker, combine tomatoes, yogurt, water, cashews, ginger garlic paste and 1 teaspoon red chili powder. Lock lid; close pressure-release valve. Adjust to pressure-cook on high for 6 minutes. Quick-release pressure. Puree mixture using an immersion blender until smooth. Strain mixture, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Wipe insert clean.\n\nSelect saute setting and adjust for medium heat; add ghee. When ghee is hot, add garam masala and remaining 1 teaspoon red chili powder; cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Stir in strained tomato mixture and sugar. Simmer, uncovered, until mixture is slightly thickened, 5-8 minutes. Add fenugreek and, if desired, cream; cook 1 minute. Pour mixture over kofta."
