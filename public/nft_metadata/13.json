      "value": "Steps:\n1) Sieve flour, cinnamon, salt, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into large bowl\n2) Mix ground walnuts and crushed biscoff in\n3) In a separate bowl, whisk eggs and sugar on medium speed for 1 minute and then add oil while mixing for another 30 seconds on high speed\n4) Add grated carrots and fold mixture slowly\n5) Combine both bowl contents together and fold gently\n6) Add vanilla extract while folding\n7) Pour into 2 large cake trays/silicone moulds\n8) Bake at 160c for 40-50 minutes\n9) Insert knife vertically in middle to check it's baked properly - if knife comes out clean, cake is ready. If wet, continue to bake and test again\n\nIcing:\n100g unsalted soft butter\n165g cream cheese\n350g icing sugar\n2 cap pure vanilla extract \n\nSteps:\n1) Beat butter until pale and fluffy\n2) Add cream cheese and continue beating\n3) Add sieved icing sugar and mix for 1-2 minutes\n4) Add vanilla extract \n5) When spreadable consistency, cover and put aside until cake ready\n\nPlace first cake on a serving plate and cover top with icing - thickness of icing is a matter of preference. Carefully place the 2nd cake on top and cover the top or entire cake with remaining icing. It helps to put the icing in the fridge for a little to give it a thicker consistency when spreading. Decorate as desired - I personally sprinkle cinnamon on top and decorate with whole or crushed pecan/walnut pieces.\n\nEnjoy! "
