Add the softened butter and knead until incorporated.\nPlace the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.\nPrepare the Filling:\n\nIn a saucepan, melt the butter and chocolate over low heat.\nRemove from heat and stir in the cocoa powder, powdered sugar, and cinnamon until smooth. Let cool.\nAssemble the Babka:\n\nPreheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).\nPunch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface into a rectangle.\nSpread the chocolate filling evenly over the dough.\nRoll the dough tightly into a log and slice it lengthwise to expose the filling.\nTwist the two halves together and place in a greased loaf pan.\nLet it rise for another 30 minutes.\nBake:\n\nBake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.\nPrepare the Syrup:\n\nWhile the babka is baking, make the syrup by combining sugar and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer until the sugar is dissolved.\nBrush the syrup over the hot babka as soon as it comes out of the oven."
