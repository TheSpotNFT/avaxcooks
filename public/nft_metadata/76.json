Submerge the cabbage head in boiling water until the leaves soften, about 5-10 minutes. Remove leaves with tongs as they become pliable.\nPlace the softened leaves in an ice bath to stop the cooking process, then drain.\nTrim the thick veins from the leaves.\n\nPrepare the Filling:\n\nIn a skillet, heat the olive oil and sauté the ground meat with the spices (allspice, cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, pepper) until browned. Allow to cool slightly.\nMix the sautéed meat with the drained rice and crushed garlic in a large bowl.\n\nStuff the Cabbage Leaves:\n\nPlace a tablespoon of the filling at the base of each cabbage leaf.\nRoll the leaf tightly, folding in the sides like a burrito to encase the filling.\n\nAssemble the Dish:\n\nLayer the bottom of a large pot with the tougher outer cabbage leaves.\nPlace the stuffed cabbage rolls seam-side down in the pot, tightly packed in layers.\nScatter the unpeeled garlic cloves between the layers.\nPour the seasoned broth (and tomato puree if using) over the cabbage rolls until just covered.\n\nCook:\n\nPlace a heatproof plate on top of the rolls to keep them submerged.\nBring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 1 hour, until the cabbage is tender.\n\nServe:\n\nRemove the plate and carefully transfer the rolls to a serving platter.\nSqueeze fresh lemon juice over the rolls and serve with lemon slices and plain yogurt on the side."
