Mix until well combined.\nGradually add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together.\nKnead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 8-10 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.\nPlace the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.\nPrepare the Raspberry Filling:\n\nIn a small saucepan, combine the raspberries, sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch.\nCook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and becomes jam-like. Remove from heat and let it cool completely.\nAssemble the Babka:\n\nPunch down the risen dough and divide it in half.\nRoll out one half of the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.\nSpread half of the raspberry filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.\nRoll up the dough tightly from one of the long sides, then twist the roll several times to create a spiral effect.\nPlace the twisted dough into a greased loaf pan. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.\nPrepare the Streusel Topping:\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the flour and sugar for the streusel topping.\nCut in the cold butter with a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nSprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the babkas.\nBake:\n\nPreheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\nLet the assembled babkas rise for another 30 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\nCool and Serve:\n\nAllow the babkas to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.\nEnjoy, Bubula!"
