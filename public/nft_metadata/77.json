Let cool.\nIn a large bowl, mix the cooked rice, ground meat, egg, and sautéed vegetables. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nStuff the Cabbage Leaves:\n\nPlace a large spoonful (about 1/2 cup) of the meat mixture on the base of each cabbage leaf.\nFold in the sides and roll up tightly.\n\nCook the Rolls:\n\nIn a large pot, layer the bottom with chopped cabbage and carrots.\nPlace the cabbage rolls seam-side down in a single layer, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and add another layer if necessary.\nIn a bowl, mix the tomato sauce, stock, and bay leaves, and pour over the rolls.\nBring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 1 hour.\n\nServe:\n\nRemove the cooked rolls from the pot.\nStir the sour cream into the remaining sauce in the pot.\nServe the cabbage rolls hot, topped with the sour cream sauce and additional sour cream if desired."
