Add mixture to the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan.\nSprinkle chicken evenly with remaining Greek seasoning. Place chicken cavity over the Bundt pan center with legs facing down on top of the vegetables. Place Bundt pan on a rimmed baking sheet. \nA whole, seasoned chicken with it's cavity on the bundt pan center, with the bundt pan filled with vegetables and sitting on a sheet pan\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cover the top half with foil after 30 minutes to avoid over-browning. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). \nRemove chicken to a serving platter or cutting board to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Toss veggies with feta and dill, and serve with sliced chicken. Top with more lemon zest.\n\n"
