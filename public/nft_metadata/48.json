Place a heavy can or skillet on top of tofu to press moisture out, pouring off excess water and replacing towels as they get soaked, 30 to 45 minutes (you can do this with a tofu press if you have one).\n\nStep 2\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 425Â°. Cut broccoli heads into florets. Thinly slice scallions and separate green and white parts. Into a medium bowl or large measuring cup, grate ginger and garlic. Add white scallion parts, broth, soy sauce, maple syrup, chili crisp, vinegar, sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon cornstarch and whisk to combine.\n\nStep 3\nBreak tofu into rough 1\" pieces and transfer to a large bowl. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, drizzle with 1 tablespoon neutral oil, and gently toss tofu to coat. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup cornstarch and gently toss until tofu is coated. Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons neutral oil.\n\nStep 4\nBake tofu, turning halfway through, until light brown and crisp, about 25 minutes.\n\nStep 5\nWhen tofu has about 12 minutes remaining, in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon neutral oil. Add broccoli; season with salt, then toss to coat broccoli with oil. Cook, stirring frequently, until broccoli is starting to char, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer broccoli to a plate.\n\nStep 6\nReduce heat to medium. Whisk sauce to reincorporate cornstarch and pour into skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Add broccoli and tofu to skillet and toss to coat in sauce. Top with green scallion parts and sesame seeds. Serve over rice.\n\nEnjoy!"
