Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPrepare the Brussels Sprouts:\n\nIn a large bowl, toss the halved Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, and black pepper until evenly coated.\nRoast the Brussels Sprouts:\n\nSpread the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the Brussels sprouts are tender and golden brown, stirring halfway through.\nPrepare the Balsamic Glaze:\n\nWhile the Brussels sprouts are roasting, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey in a small saucepan.\nBring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the mixture has reduced by half and has a syrupy consistency, about 5-7 minutes.\nCombine and Serve:\n\nRemove the roasted Brussels sprouts from the oven and transfer them to a serving dish.\nDrizzle the balsamic glaze over the Brussels sprouts and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and chopped walnuts (if using).\nServe warm."
